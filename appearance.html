		<h1>What did it look like?</h1>
		<p class="textalign"><img src="img/carchlook.jpg" alt="Meg Reconnn" align="right">Since this creature was alive before it could be recorded, there is no definitve intepretation of what it looked like. One intepretation (and without a doubt the most popular one) is that it was a robust-looking shark and closely resembles the great white shark. Key differences with this specific interpretation, however, are a wider and blunter jaw, thicker fins, and smaller eyes. Another, less popular interpretation is that it closely resembles the whale shark or basking shark. Key features in this interpretation include a crescent shaped tail fin, a small anal and second dorsal fin, and a caudal keel on both sides of the tail fin. This build is consistent with marine animals of this size to reduce drag while swimming. <a href ="teeth.html">

		</a>The size of the megalodon is a topic that is subject to disagreement. Some scientists assert that its maximum size could be as small as 43 feet to as large as 82 feet. It's possible that different population of megalodon around the seas had different body sizes and behvaiors due to different ecological pressures. While there is no one correct estimate, the commonly accepted estimate today is that it's maximum length was at about 60 feet (and its average size being 34 feet). If this estimation is true, then the megalodon would surpass the largest known first to have ever lived, the Jurassic fish leedsichthys (which could grow up to 50 feet). Its estimated that a mature male megalodons could have a mass of 12.6 to 33.9 metric tons, while mature female megalodons could have a mass of 27.4 to 59.4 metric tons. The graph below illustrates and compares the sizes of a megalodon at maximum growth, a megalodon at conservative growth, an average whale shark (currently the world's largest living fish), an average great white shark, and an average human man. <i>Click on the megalodon tooth image on the right  and above to learn about megalodon teeth.</i></p>
