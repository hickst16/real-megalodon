	<h1>Where did it live?</h1>
	<p>The megalodon had comsopolitan distribution, meaning that it was found in all parts of the world wherever there was a suitable habitat. Fossils have been excavated from Europe, Asia, AfricA, Oceania, and the Americas. I most freuqently lives in subtropidal and temperate latitudes. They lives in a wide range of habitats including shallow coastl waters, areas of coastsl upwelling, swampy coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshoredeep sea water environments. They also could have lived in offshore environments, for example, many megalodon teeth have been excavated from the Marianas Trench (the deepest point in all of the oceans). Below is a map of megalodon fossil discoveries found around the world. Yellow is for megalodons from the Pliocene while blue is for meglaodons from the Miocene.</p>
