		<p class="textalign">The megalodon (carcharon megalodon or carcharocles megalodon) is an extinct species of shark that lived between 23 to 2.6 million years ago, doing the Early Miocene to the end of the Pilocene. Some scientists believe it's closely related to the great white shark, while others believe it was part of a completely different shark family. Presently, it is mostly agreed upon that it was likely not a part of the grest white shark family, but a part of the extinct family Otodontidae. The Otodontidae family was also known was the "megatoothed shark" family, and also had other sharks like the carcharocles angustidens (which could grow up to 29 feet). The megaladon has caught a lot of attention ranging from countless "mockumentaries" (like Discovery Channel's <i>Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives</i> and History Channel's <i>Jurassic Flight Club</i>) to potential (but not evidence based) sightings of a gargantuan shark longer than 90 feet. Additionally, this shark has been subject of folklore, specifically a Polynesian myth regarding a 100 foot shark known as "Lord of the Deep".<img src="img/JawsBalt.jpg" alt="Jaws Recon" align="right" style="padding-top: 5px" style="padding-left:5px">In the late 1800s the HMS Challenger (a Royal Navy corevtte) erroneously dated megalodon teeth to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old. The reasoning for this wrongful dating was because the tooth seemed fresh due to its well preservation (because of a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide that slowed decomposition and retained its white color). Another reason why some may believe its still alive is because the teeth are often redeposited into stratums that are younger than itself. These report caused people to speculate if they could possibly still be roaming the unknown corners of the ocean. Of course, however, these are all speculations. This organism is most definitely extinct in all ways possible. As indicated by the jaw reconstruction above (which currently sits at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland), this shark was really, really big. Since sharks aren't very bony and are mostly made of cartilage, teeth are the main fossils we have left from these animals. Teeth play an important role in estimating size and other factors like feeding pattern and bite force.</p>
